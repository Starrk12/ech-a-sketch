Technologies Employed:

HTML: The project uses HTML to structure the web page, create the grid, and define various controls.
CSS: CSS is employed to style the web page, grid, controls, and brushes, ensuring a visually appealing interface.
JavaScript: JavaScript is the primary scripting language used for interactivity. It handles user interactions, drawing functionality, and dynamic updates.
Working Principle:
The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to replicate the functionality of the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy on a web page. Users can draw on the grid, change pen colors, erase, clear the grid, and adjust grid settings.

Grid Creation: The JavaScript code dynamically creates a grid of squares based on the specified grid size. The grid size can be adjusted using a slider.

Drawing: Users can draw on the grid by hovering the mouse cursor over the squares. Depending on the selected brush mode, the square's background color changes. Brush modes include custom color, random color, eraser, and background color.

Controls: The project includes control buttons for various actions:

Brush Selection: Users can select different brush modes for drawing.
Color Picker: Users can choose custom pen colors.
Clear Button: Clears the entire grid.
Grid Lines Toggle: Toggles the visibility of grid lines.
Grid Size Slider: Adjusts the grid size dynamically.
Responsive Design: The web page is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience on different screen sizes.

Features:

Dynamic Grid: Users can choose the size of the drawing grid, allowing for larger or smaller sketches.
Color Selection: Users can pick custom colors for drawing or use a random color mode for fun.
Eraser: An eraser mode allows users to clear specific parts of their sketch.
Clear Grid: The "Clear" button clears the entire grid for a fresh start.
Grid Lines: Users can toggle grid lines on or off for guidance while drawing.
Responsive: The web page is responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
